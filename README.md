## Usage

Once installed, New applets will appear on the sidebar when you create flows.

### Applets

#### Dial Record

This works exactly the same wai as the standard Dial applet with a few additional features:

1. You have the option of telling the caller something before the dial happens. This is useful for "call may be recorded" messages.
2. You can record the dial as it is ringing or when it is answered. It is recommended that you wait until the call is answered.
